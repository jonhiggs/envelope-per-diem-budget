# Budget

## Rational

- Envelope budgets are great
- Hard to track spending on cards
- Cash is private
- Keeps you mindful
- Easy to get back on the wagon


## Rules

All living costs are to come from per-diem:

- Food
- Fuel
- Entertainment
- Consumables
- Small purchases (books, music, clothing)
- Large purchases (furniture, toys, gadgets)


Any ongoing commitments are considered bills. As they cannot be manipulated by mindful spending, they are excluded:

- Rent
- Electricity
- Internet
- Telephone


Emergencies do not need to come from per-diem:

- Any medical treatment
- Car repairs
- Appliance replacement
